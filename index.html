            <h3><span class="head">About Myself</span> </h3>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to
                feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the
                clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
                of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to
                sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like
                country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat
                cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic
                movies. I like the land and the nature.</p>
